Learning Neural Networks 


Inputs - either it is data from a training set or from another neuron 

Weights -parameter we tune to help our model improve
Bias -  other parameter we tune to help our model improve

For each input there has to be a matching weight. For one set of inputs and weights there has to be 1 bias number 

Function we use:
((inputs[i]*weight[i]) + (inputs[i+1]*weight[i+1]) + ...) + bias 


Tensor obeject = array 

Hidden Layer - the layers of the neural network that are neither input or output
