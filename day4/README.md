Merge sort  (O n log n)
Linked List (Nodes/Dictionaries) they store a key:value pair and if the key is NULL it means that there is no next node 
Double linked list -> pointer pointing back to previous node 


NODES:
leaf- Node w/o children(other nodes attached)
root- Node with multiple nodes attached 

Binary Search Tree(BST)
search/insert/delete


Heap - tree based data structure where parent nodes have greater than or equal to priority as their child nodes. Use this over BST--Has Priority Queue 

Traversals 

Depth First Search - returns the depths of the tree following down one node and its children until leaf // Can use stack(push&pop)/recursion

Breadth First Search - Does levels checking all values in the level and returning that // Queue [FIFO (first in first out)]

Graphs - collection of vertices of points/edges from one to anoter// think connecting people to other people via them knowing other people (source node to target node - shortest path)
